# Golang Specs
This program is written in golang using OOPs paradigm design. Although, Go doesn't it but Go has types and methods and allows 
an object-oriented style of programming, there is no type hierarchy. The concept of “interface” in Go provides a 
different approach that we believe is easy to use and in some ways more general. There are also ways to embed types in other 
types to provide something analogous — but not identical — to subclassing. Moreover, methods in Go are more general than in 
C++ or Java: they can be defined for any sort of data, even built-in types such as plain, “unboxed” integers. They are not 
restricted to structs (classes).
